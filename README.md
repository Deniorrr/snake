## General info
Classic game, however you can customize many things like:
* size of the board
* speed of the game
* starting position and direction of the snake
* colors of the snake and apples
	
## Setup
To run the project download the repo and start up "index.html"

## User manual
1. (Optional) Assign settings to your preferences.  
Game speed is calculated as shown below:
```js
board.speed = 1000 / input.speed //in miliseconds
```
So for example if you set the speed to 10, the game will update every 100 miliseconds
## Inspiration
I was bored at my programming lessons so I wrote the core of the game. Then at home I finished it up.
